        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a second year Game Design and Development Student at RIT. I've been involved in sports for most of my
            life. I've been developing games since I was 14. I'm a firm believer pineapples belong on pizzas. I
            once flipped a water bottle that then stuck the landing on the cap side of the bottle.

        <h3>My life</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Culpeper, Virginia lived their till I was around 2. After that, my family moved out to the
            country side of the state to a place called Louisa, and stayed thier till I was 6. We then moved north to a
            more urban area to a place called Stafford. I have lived around their ever since.
